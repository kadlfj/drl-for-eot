This repository shows an example implementation of the algorithm presented in a paper published in the journal of Measurement Science and Technology.

In this paper, deep reinforcement learning algorithm and recursive Kalman filter are integrated to optimize elliptical parameters and unknown multiplicative noise covariance in extended object tracking by using the adaptive ability of interaction between deep reinforcement learning and environment, so as to improve the accuracy of extended object tracking estimation.
