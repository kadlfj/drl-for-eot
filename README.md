This repository shows an example implementation of the algorithm presented in a paper published in the journal of Measurement Science and Technology. The title is "Adaptive Elliptical Extended Object Tracking Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning"
In this paper, deep reinforcement learning algorithm and recursive Kalman filter are integrated to optimize elliptic parameters and unknown multiplicative noise covariance in extended target tracking by using the adaptive ability of interaction between deep reinforcement learning and environment, so as to improve the accuracy of extended target tracking estimation.
